### Defects of Note



1- I had problem with site.webmanifest

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99558735/163054423-d85ec936-aac4-48c8-b51a-a310a4cda860.png)

 By restating the pc the problem was solved after trying to empty cache and hard reload.
  
  
2- Navigation for small devices was not compatible

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99558735/163054862-a22a8d71-a38a-4897-bae6-c874810b78b2.png)

 By adding the right media queries it was fixed.


3- Sign up form was dark and hard to notice

 By working on these sites that helped me very much i was able to find a match :
