### Design Choices
This site targets all different ages that are in love with fishing and looking for adventures, soo i built a site with attractive images, easy access for all ages and provide show the activities the club does with the prices they offer .


#### Colors

- The main colours used in the website are a easy on the eyes of the users .
- The combination of colors are used from a site called colors.co and that the link of the combination that i used https://coolors.co/e0d6d3-f1cba6-ead5c4-010206-031627
- The colors look like :

#### Typography

- The combination of the fonts Roboto, Poppins and Droid sans is used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case of import failure.

#### Images

I used this image because it shows different ages of people that are fishing and that is the aim of the site is to target all ages.

#### Animations and Transitions

- Flex for small devices like mobiles

### Wireframes

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in a separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser. 

Wireframes can be as simple as a picture of a drawing of how you envisioned laying out the information for you pages in desktop, tablet and mobile views. They are a roadmap and do not have to be 100% accurate of the final product.

### Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so and how they tie into  your user stories.

#### Implemented Features

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

It's easiest to break this section down into the header, footer, and each page/layer of your website. Call out any differences for mobile vs desktop presentations, include a screenshot of the implemented feature.

Don't forget your 404 error page.

#### Future Features

**In the future i will add a lot of features:**
like booking a fishing guides with a schedule table shown all the date, time and ages that can join.
Adding a feature of loaning fishing gears before they attempt to go to the trip so the users enjoy their trip with no stress of broken gear or unsutable equipment. 



## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Validation Testing
The code is valid and follows proper indentation. I tested the code on these two sites

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99558735/162940741-3a820dab-b5c0-4819-be41-fcfb11b6656f.png)

- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) 
 
 
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

### Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing
Create a table that lists out what devices, browsers, and operating system you tested your application on and a brief description of why you chose the mixture you did. The point is to prove that you looked at the site across various browsers, operating systems, and viewport breakpoints.

### Defect Tracking

You should mention  any  bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

Here is a [Defect Tracking Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYB4X4wTCNEW_Y1no3hsGbclh2bLokl_I5Ev3s5EuJA/edit?usp=sharing) you use as a starting point to track defects. Make a copy of the sheet to your own account and update the Features sheet to match your project. 


### Defects of Note
Some defects are more pesky than others. Highlight 3-5 of the bugs that drove you the most nuts and how you finally ended up resolving them.


### Outstanding Defects
It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found. If you know of something that isn't quite right, list it out and explain why you chose not to resolve it.

## Accessibility

Accessibility testing is aimed to make sure that those with visual or physical disabilities can still browse your website. Some users have had strokes or accidents that make it difficult to use a mouse so they use keyboard keys to tab through sites. Others use screen readers that rely on HTML tags to help the user navigate quickly through the site to find information they want, others have color blindness or contrast issues. It's the law to provide services 
Here's a [site](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#:~:text=Accessibility%20is%20Important%20for%20Individuals%2C%20Businesses%2C%20Society,-The%20Web%20is&text=That%20is%2C%20the%20accessibility%20barriers,older%20people) where you can learn more about accessibility and the internet.

### Lighthouse Audits


### Keyboard Navigation
Another way to accessibility test you site is to try to click on the browser and see what happens if you use the tab, arrow and enter keys. Does it work well or does the user get stuck?

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages).

Enumerate steps and use screenshots to make the instructions are clear.


You may want to re-watch the [initial deployment in gitpod video](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LR101+2021_T1/courseware/4a07c57382724cfda5834497317f24d5/9b06129195c64fada6783de9cfe82d60/) when writing up this section.


Write out steps you would take and test them to deploy your code to GitHub Pages, include screenshots if you think they would make the process easier.

## Credits

To avoid plagiarism amd copyright infringement, you should mention any other projects, stackoverflow, videos, blogs, etc that you used to gather imagery or ideas for your code even if you used it as a starting point and modified things. Giving credit to other people's efforts and ideas that saved you time acknowledges the hard work others did. 

### Content

Use bullet points to list out sites you copied text from and cross-reference where those show up on your site

### Media

Make a list of sites you used images from. If you used several sites try to match up each image to the correct site. This includes attribution for icons if they came from font awesome or other sites, give them credit.

### Acknowledgments

This is the section where you refer to code examples, mentors, blogs, stack overflow answers and videos that helped you accomplish your end project. Even if it's an idea that you updated you should note the site and why it was important to your completed project.

If you used a CodeInstitute Example project as a starting point. Make note of that here.
